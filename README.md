# wes_scripts
Scripts created for homework or projects for my Wesleyan classes.

In this repo, you will find the scripts and write ups to homeworks from select classes that I took at Wesleyan.
The purpose of this repo is for me to store all these files, but also to showcase this work.

Each folder is titled after the course number.
