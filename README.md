# wes_scripts
Scripts created for homework or projects for my Wesleyan classes.

In this repo, you will find the scripts and write ups to homeworks from select classes that I took at Wesleyan.
The purpose of this repo is for me to store all these files, but also to showcase this work.

Each folder is titled after the course number.
You can find the course title and the semester I took the course below.
